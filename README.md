# Sales Process Automation using Python 

## Project Overview
This project automates key aspects of the sales process using Python programming and AI/ML techniques. The goal is to streamline lead generation, email outreach, and campaign analytics with minimal manual intervention.

This project automates the sales outreach process for a T-shirt manufacturing business targeting IT companies in Ahmedabad. The system is designed to scrape leads, generate personalized emails, send them via SMTP, track engagement, and categorize leads using analytics‚Äîall with one command.

You will be able to:
- Scrape business leads from Google Maps based on your target Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).
- Extract relevant contact data including emails by visiting each company website.
- Generate personalized email templates for outreach.
- Automate the sending of emails in batches to avoid spam filters.
- Track email opens and clicks using a lightweight Flask server.
- Collect and analyze campaign performance metrics.

## Step-by-Step Process Explanation

### Step 1: Lead Scraping & Email Extraction
- Using `map_lead.py`, the project scrapes company details such as name, website, address, and phone from Google Maps focused on IT companies in Ahmedabad.
- Since email addresses are not directly available, the script visits each company‚Äôs website and extracts email addresses by scanning the web page content.
- The final structured data is saved into an Excel file `scraped_it_companies_ahmedabad_with_emails.xlsx` for further use.

### Step 2: Email Generation
- The `generate_emails.py` script reads the Excel file and creates personalized emails using a predefined HTML email template.
- Dynamic placeholders such as `[Company Name]` and `[Recipient Name]` are replaced with actual data from the Excel sheet.
- This step prepares customized outreach emails for each lead.

### Step 3: Tracking Setup
- A lightweight Flask app in `tracking_server.py` serves a tracking pixel embedded in every email.
- When a recipient opens the email, the tracking pixel loads and registers the event.
- This enables the system to collect open and click analytics for the email campaign.

### Step 4: Sending Emails
- The `send_emails.py` script sends personalized emails by reading the leads Excel file.
- It supports batching and delay between emails to avoid spam detection and throttling by email providers.
- Each email includes the tracking pixel to monitor recipient engagement.

### Step 5: Automation
- The `automate_campaign.py` script automates the entire pipeline.
- It checks dependencies, runs lead scraping, generates emails, starts the tracking server, sends the email campaign, and then stops the server.
- All steps and results are logged to a timestamped log file for monitoring.
